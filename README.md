vampire materials library

The vampire materials library (VML) is a set of magnetic material parameters for use with the vampire software package. The aim is to combine a database of information about important magnetic materials and their properties with ready-to-use input files allowing anyone to simulate the properties of these materials at the atomistic level. Initially the number of materials is small but it is expected that this will library will be an essential resource for all researchers interested in magnetic materials and properties.

If you use model parameters from the VML please cite the following paper in addition to any papers listed under the specific material entries which you use.

In general there can be two sets of parameters for each material. The first is for a generic model, where the parameters are typically determined from simple theoretical relations or empirically from experimental observations and published data. The second set is for parameters determined from first principles calculations of the electronic structure such as Density Functional Theory or sKKR. It is intended that the VML is a 'living community library', with the parameters for each material representing the best that is currently available. However, for archival reasons all previous entries will be available to view and download. Community contributions in terms of raw model parameters and associated results and data are warmly welcomed.
